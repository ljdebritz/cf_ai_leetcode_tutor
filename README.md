## AI leetcode Tutor

### Overview
Grinding LeetCode to improve knowledge of data structures and algorithms is a universal experience for those looking for work in the software field.
Throughout my studies, I've found myself in one of three stages many times:

**Can't get started**
: We have all been here. You read the problem description and can't quite figure out what they are asking you to do, or maybe all you can think of is the brute force solution, but you can tell that's not what your interviewer will be looking for. Now, what can you do? Maybe this problem has some hints, but perhaps it doesn't. You don't want to look at the solution; you want to learn how to identify which algorithm can be used to solve problems like these. So maybe you skip that one and move on, but that doesn't help!

**Passing some test cases**
: This time, you see the problem and think you have a good idea of how to go about it. Take some notes, draw some diagrams on a whiteboard, and get to coding. You finish up and run the three test cases there, all green and good to go. Then you press submit and see *pased 22/87 test cases*. What now? Maybe you are going about the problem in the right way, and it's just going to take a few tweaks to get you there. Although there's a chance you choose the wrong strategy and you'll end up making a fix that passes a new case but fails one you were passing before. Now you go and read the solution and say, "Ah, how could I miss that?" But the next time you see a problem like this, you do the same thing, because you didn't actually absorb it after just looking at the solution.

**Correct but slow**
: Now it's different, you've seen a problem like this before, you know what you need to do to solve it. You code up your solution and boom! You passed. Then you see that your runtime only beats 2% of submissions in Python :/. Whoops, that's not going to cut it. The same issue presents itself; just looking at the solution won't help you actually learn where you went wrong and how to improve next time. 

These stopping points are exactly where I got the idea for an AI tutor to help you out when you get stuck.
Now you can go to the webpage:
1) Enter the leet code problem you're working on
2) Select which of the above modes you've found yourself in
3) Write out your thought process on the problem so far
4) Add in whatever you have for a solution so far, and submit

Now your LeetCode tutor will offer you hints to help you get on the right track. Your tutor will also suggest to you other LeetCode problems that deal with the same patterns
that are simpler, so that you can go and review the topics. Another cool feature of the tutor is that they will remember what problems you've worked on before and how you succeeded or struggled, so your tutor can give you even more personalized advice or notice trends in your struggles, helping you narrow your focus on specific trouble areas.
